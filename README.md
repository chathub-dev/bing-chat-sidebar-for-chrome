## Supported browsers

This extension uses the [chrome.sidePanel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/sidePanel/) API, which is only available since Chrome 114. Therefore it only works with Google Chrome, version 114 or higher, and may not be compatible with other Chromium-based browsers, such as Brave, Arc, Opera, etc.

## Privacy

This extension does not collect any user data. Requests are sent directly from your browser to Bing's server using HTTPS. There is no middle server and no one else can see the requests, responses and their content.
